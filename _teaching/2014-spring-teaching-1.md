#[Machine learning for mechanics (APL405)](https://coursesam.github.io/APL405/) is an introductory course to statistical machine learning for students with some background in calculus, linear algebra and statistics. The course is focusing on supervised learning, i.e, classification and regression. My role in this course was to assist with the hands-on sessions and grading of assignments.
